# Mg-Calcite-Thermodynamics

In this project, we used measurements of the magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) content of natural calcite crystals from 
\deep-sea sediments to infer the thermodynamics of how the Mg/Ca ratio of calcite crystals varies with
\the Mg/Ca ratio of the growth fluid at near-equilibrium conditions.

Earth Scientists want to understand the fundamentals of crystal growth in nature
\and how the composition of calcite can tell us about what was going on in the surrounding
\environment at the time of formation.

I performed cross-sectional transect sampling of Mg/Ca element ratios in natural carbonate crystals 
\from Ocean Drilling Program Site 807 measured via electron probe microanalysis at UC Davis. 

This Matlab script pulls image data from a structured dataset, performs background filtering and scaling, 
\and records Mg/Ca values of pixel transects extending from the crystal center outwards.
\Finally, it plots the Mg/Ca element map and displays the position of the transects, and
\also plots the Mg/Ca values of the pixels for each transect as a function of distance from the crystal exterior.
